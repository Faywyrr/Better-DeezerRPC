Better Deezer-RPC is the only Rich Presence for Deezer to integrate **DIRECTLY** into the default Deezer desktop application.
</br>No need for additional installation, a small batch script is enough!

## Installation

*Caution! The Windows Store application is difficult to modify because of the permissions, but it works theoretically.
</br>We advise you to download the Windows application [here](https://www.deezer.com/desktop/download?platform=win32&architecture=x86).*


**Download last release [here](https://github.com/Faywyrr/Better-DeezerRPC/releases/).**
</br>__Node.js is required!__

To install it, you only need to run the **install.bat** when Deezer is closed.
</br>If you have changed the location of the application you can indicate it in the file :
```batch
:: Configuration

set App=%LocalAppdata%\Programs\deezer-desktop
```
