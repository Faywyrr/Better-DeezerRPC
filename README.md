## Installation

*Caution! The Windows Store application is difficult to modify because of the permissions, but it works theoretically.
</br>We advise you to download the Windows application [here](https://www.deezer.com/desktop/download?platform=win32&architecture=x86).*

**Download last release [here](https://github.com/Faywyrr/Better-DeezerRPC/releases/latest/).**
It supports Windows and Linux (you must have nodejs installed for linux).

**For installation, please see the release!**

If you have changed the location of the application you can indicate it in the file :
```batch
:: Configuration

set App=%LocalAppdata%\Programs\deezer-desktop
```
